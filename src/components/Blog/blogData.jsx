          "Activated carbon, derived from various carbon-rich materials like coal, rice husk, paddy husk, coconut shells, and wood, is highly valued for its adsorption properties. Coconut shells, in particular, are an ideal source due to their low ash content, high carbon content, and natural pore structure. This makes coconut shell-activated carbon highly effective for applications like gas and vapor adsorption, as well as color and odor removal. The fine macro-pore structure of coconut shell-activated carbon makes it particularly efficient in these tasks, setting it apart from carbon derived from other sources. Additionally, its large internal surface area makes it an excellent pre-filter in water purification systems, where it adsorbs various contaminants from drinking water."

First, the raw material is carbonized by heating it in an inert atmosphere, such as flue gas, to remove moisture and volatile compounds. The second stage is the activation process, where the carbonized material is exposed to steam at high temperatures (900°C to 1100°C), enlarging the pore structure and increasing the internal surface area. The steam reacts with the carbon, removing it from the pore walls and creating larger, more effective pores for adsorption. The resulting activated carbon is then crushed, screened, and sometimes ground into a finer powder depending on the intended application."
