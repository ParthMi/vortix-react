              Coconut shell activated carbon, derived from coconut husk, is a vapor-activated material. Since it contains no chemical agents, it ensures that when applied on a medium, it does not contaminate or react with it. This eco-friendly product has a minimal carbon footprint and is highly effective at adsorbing impurities due to its microporous molecular structure.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is widely used for applications such as the purification of drinking water, air filtration, and industrial processes. Its high abrasion resistance and unique physical properties make it ideal for the recovery of gold and other precious metals.
